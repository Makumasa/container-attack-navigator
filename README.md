# MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator in a container

![Linter](https://github.com/reuteras/container-attack-navigator/workflows/Linter/badge.svg)

My Docker container for the [MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator] (https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator). 

It builds a static version of Navigator v4.1 site, as used in SEC530 Lab 1.1, and serves it via nginx.
